## 📝 Adding New Scripts

When adding new scripts to this directory:

1. **Follow naming convention**: Use descriptive names with `.sh` extension
2. **Add shebang**: Start with `#!/bin/bash`
3. **Include help**: Add `--help` or `-h` option
4. **Error handling**: Include proper error handling and exit codes
5. **Documentation**: Update this README with script description
6. **Permissions**: Make executable with `chmod +x`

### Script Template
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Script description
# Usage: ./scripts/script-name.sh [options]

set -e  # Exit on error
set -u  # Exit on undefined variable

# Default values
VERBOSE=false
DRY_RUN=false

# Help function
show_help() {
    echo "Usage: $0 [options]"
    echo "Options:"
    echo "  -h, --help     Show this help"
    echo "  -v, --verbose  Verbose output"
    echo "  -d, --dry-run  Show what would be done"
}

# Parse arguments
while [[ $# -gt 0 ]]; do
    case $1 in
